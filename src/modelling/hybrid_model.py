# Data used: both ratings.csv + movies.csv

# 💬 In simple words:

# This is the best of both worlds.

# It combines:

# What people like (CF)

# What the movie is about (CB)

# It can handle more cases.
# For example:

# CF can’t recommend new movies (no ratings yet).
# CB can, because it looks at the genres.
# Hybrid blends both, so it stays smart even when data is missing.
