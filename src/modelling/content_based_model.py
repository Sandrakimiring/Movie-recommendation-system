# """Data used: movies.csv

# 💬 In simple words:

# This method looks at the movie’s details instead of people’s opinions.

# It asks:

# “What is this movie about?”
# “What kind of movies does Sandra usually watch?”
# “If she liked Avengers, she’ll probably like Iron Man — same genre!”

# So it matches users to movies based on content similarity (like genre, cast, description).""""
